### OneDrive (Google Cloud, DropBox)
Make sure to take full advantage of all the facilities offered by your University. Having a backup of all of your work online is a good practise. In most Universities they have OneDrive offered to every student.

## Collabrative Working
This one is usually based on what the group decides on. Best way to communicate with your collegues is either through email if it requires very little communication.

### Stand-up
It is best that when you are working on a group project that you have a weekly meeting to ensure that everyone is on track and knows what they are doing. This should be done either in person or on a conference application like Discord, Zoom or Microsoft Teams.

## Deadlines

If you read something today, say, August 10th, you’d re-read it on the 11th, 12th, and the 17th." [1]
